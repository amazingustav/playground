     * Given an input grid of mine locations, for each non-mine location compute the count of adjacent locations
     * containing mines of the 8 neighboring grid locations.
     *
     * E.g. input (1 -> mine, 0 -> free):
     * 1 0 0 0
     * 0 0 1 0
     * 0 1 0 0
     * 0 0 0 0
     *
     * result (-1 -> mine, others -> adjacent amount):
     * -1  2  1  1
     *  1  3 -1  1
     *  1 -1  2  1
     *  1  1  1  0
     *
     * So if the input is the grid above, and the coordinates were 0 and 1 (line, column), the output must be 2.
